  "description": [
    "The Union Cabinet recently approved an amendment to the Second Schedule of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 for specifying the rate of royalty in respect of 3 critical and strategic minerals, namely, Lithium, Niobium and Rare Earth Elements (REEs). This amendment was passed by the Parliament and came into effect from 17th August, 2023. It delisted Lithium and Niobium from the list of atomic minerals, thereby allowing private sector concessions for these minerals through auction. It also provided that mining lease and composite license of 24 critical and strategic minerals, including Lithium, Niobium and REEs, shall be auctioned by the Central Government.",
    "Today's approval of the Union Cabinet of specification of royalty rate will enable the Central Government to auction blocks for Lithium, Niobium and REEs for the first time in India. The Second Schedule of the MMDR Act provides a default royalty rate of 12% of the Average Sale Price (ASP) for minerals whose royalty rate is not specified. This rate, however, is not comparable with other mineral producing countries. The Union Cabinet has thus specified a reasonable royalty rate of 3% of London Metal Exchange price for Lithium, 3% of Average Sale Price for Niobium and 1% of Average Sale Price of Rare Earth Oxide for REEs.",
    "Critical minerals such as Lithium and REEs have become essential for economic development and national security in the country. India is committed towards energy transition and achieving net-zero emission by 2070. Geological Survey of India (GSI) has handed over exploration reports of REE and Lithium blocks and is conducting exploration for other critical and strategic minerals. The Central Government is planning to launch the first tranche of the auction of critical and strategic minerals such as Lithium, REE, Nickel, Platinum Group of Elements, Potash, Glauconite, Phosphorite, Graphite, Molybdenum, etc. shortly."

  "description": [
    "The International Gender Conference at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR-NASC Pusa) commenced with President of India Smt Droupadi Murmu inaugurating the four-day event. The conference, which focuses on just and resilient agri-food systems, brings together business leaders, model farmers, and scientists to address challenges faced by women and youth agri-preneurs, such as lack of access to finance, limited land ownership, informal and unpaid work, and few opportunities to voice their needs.",
    "The second day saw a total of 18 parallel sessions, with presentations of more than 80 scientific posters on topics such as remedies for reducing the drudgeries of women farmers in post-harvest processing of millets, gender gaps among women street vendors and hawkers, and gendered drivers of seed choice among farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.",
    "Dr Nicoline de Haan, Director of the CGIAR GENDER Impact Platform, highlighted the significance of the conference, noting that women are often less food secure than men, and are hit harder by external shocks, such as floods and droughts. She expressed the need to guide policy-makers and investors towards best-bet solutions that can help to achieve Global Goals on gender equality and women’s empowerment.",
    "The panel discussion on the second day of the conference featured Smt. Anusha Jookuri, Founder and Director of Bee Fresh Products; Shri Dhruv Tomar, Founder and Managing Director of M Lense Research Private Limited; Shri Jyotsna Kaur Habibullah, CEO of Lucknow Farmers Market; and Dr. Akriti Sharma, CEO of Pusa Krishi and Senior Scale Scientist at ICAR. The panelists discussed the lack of access to finance for women agri-preneurs as well as the invisibility of women's unpaid work.",
    "Dr Soma K Parthasarathy delivered a keynote presentation, proposing that a move towards circular economies could be achieved by granting women access to spaces in which they can make their voices heard, by making women count in data, and through exchanges of seeds. She also suggested that women’s roles and voices in climate discourse and in the formulation of policies on land and forest conservation should be enhanced.",
    "Shri Eleanor Dean, General Manager of Outreach & Capacity Building, at the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), closed the session by noting that poverty and inequality are underpinned by unequal power relations that are not exclusive to gender, and that ACIAR has expanded its work to encompass gender equality and social inclusion."

    "The Indian government has recently implemented a Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for White Goods which includes Air Conditioners (ACs) and LED Lights. This scheme has an outlay of 6,238 crore rupees and is designed to create a complete component ecosystem for the Air Conditioner and LED Lights industry in India. The goal of the scheme is to increase domestic value addition from 15-20% to 75-80%. ",
    "Various changes have been made to the Scheme Guidelines with a view to simplify the operation of the Scheme as well as to improve the ease of doing business. These changes include adoption of the Cost-Plus method, investments in Tool rooms for manufacturing, allowing one extra year for informing the establishment of an additional manufacturing facility, revision of the last date of submission of filing claims, refund of excess incentive, site visit by the Administrative Ministry and rolling over of Bank Guarantee.",
    "Out of the 64 selected beneficiaries, 15 beneficiaries have already started commercial production while the rest are at different stages of implementation. This PLI Scheme for White Goods is in line with the Prime Minister’s call for “Atmanirbhar Bharat” and is expected to create more jobs and drive India’s growth."

  "title": "\"Gaganyaan\" Test Vehicle Space flight, that is, \"Gaganyaan\" Test Vehicle Development flight (TV-D1) scheduled on 21st October, says Union Minister Dr Jitendra Singh",
  "description": [
    "The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Science & Technology; MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh, recently announced the launch of India's first human spaceflight mission, 'Gaganyaan', to be conducted on the 21st of this month. The mission, developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), will test the Crew Escape System as well as the Crew Module which will carry the astronauts to outer space.",
    "The test involves launching the Crew Module to outer space and bringing it back to Earth, where it will be recovered by the Indian Navy. The success of this test will set the stage for the first unmanned mission and ultimately a manned mission to outer space in low Earth orbit. This is planned for 2024, and will be preceded by a test flight next year, which will carry the female robot astronaut, 'Vyommitra'.",
    "The Gaganyaan project envisages the demonstration of human spaceflight capabilities by launching a crew to an orbit of 400 km and bringing them back safely to earth. This requires the development of critical technologies such as a human-rated launch vehicle, Life Support System, and crew emergency escape provisions. The mission also requires the management of crew training, recovery and rehabilitation.",
    "India is one of the top five countries in the field of space exploration, having recently created history by becoming the first country to land on the virgin south polar region of the lunar surface. The launch of Aditya-1, the first space-based Indian mission to study the Sun, has further cemented India's standing in the field of space science and technology.",
    "Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has enabled India's space scientists to fulfill the dream of their founding father Vikram Sarabhai by 'unlocking' India's space sector and providing a suitable environment for the country's potential and talent to be showcased to the world. This has resulted in an exponential increase in the number of Space Startups, from 4 to 150 since the sector was opened up in June 2020.",
    "India's space missions are designed to be cost-effective and the applications of space technology have improved the ease of living for the common man, with its use in sectors such as Railways, Highways, Agriculture, Water Mapping, Smart Cities, Telemedicine and Robotic Surgery. Additionally, India's disaster capabilities have become world-class during Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's tenure of nine years.",
    "ISRO is the epitome of India's Naarishakti, with women scientists participating and leading the various activities in space research programmes. To recognize the achievements of ISRO scientists associated with the Chandrayaan mission, the Union Minister recently felicitated them."

  "description": [
    "The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Small Farmers Agri-Business Association (SFAC), and Common Service Centers (CSC) recently organized a Farmer Producer Organization (FPO) Mela at INA Market, Delhi Haat. Major FPOs from all over the country exhibited their products from over 20 FPOs, allowing visitors to experience the natural produce.",
    "FPOs are groups of farmers that manage commercial farming activities in their local area. They provide farmers with discounted prices on agricultural inputs such as manure, seeds, fertilizers and equipment, and help them sell their finished crops and produce.",
    "The government has either formed or is in the process of forming an FPO in every block in the country, with more than 2,165 FPOs of 8 lakh farmers currently doing business through the online platform ONDC. CSCs are providing rural citizens with access to a variety of government services at their doorstep, such as caste, income, domicile, character certificates, and employment registration.",
    "CSCs have played an important role in the e-governance sector, with more than 5.5 lakh CSCs located in rural areas of the country. Similarly, FPOs are a crucial part of the agricultural sector, with an estimated 12 crore small and marginal farmers in India with an average land holding size of less than 1.1 hectares.",
    "The FPO Mela was a successful event that showcased the products and services offered by FPOs, as well as providing a platform for farmers to learn about the benefits and how to access FPO services. The government's focus on promoting FPOs is a welcome step that will help to empower farmers and boost the rural economy."
